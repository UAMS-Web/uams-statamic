/**
 * Answers one question for the clinical provider lens: does anything render
 * BETWEEN the two appointment CTAs (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#1695)?
 *
 * WordPress renders the appointment block twice and gates the second instance on
 * `$show_appointment_section` AND at least one intervening section having
 * rendered, before it sets `$appointment_block_instance = 2`.
 *
 * Ours rendered instance 2 whenever instance 1 rendered, so a provider with an
 * appointment CTA and nothing else — no bio, clinical focus, expertise,
 * conditions, treatments, locations, podcast, resources, credentials, or awards
 * — saw the same block twice with nothing between them.
 *
 * Why a resolver rather than the call site: reproducing the gate in Antlers means
 * restating every intervening section's own condition where the second CTA is
 * included, and ten conditions copied into an eleventh place drift the moment a
 * section is added, removed, or re-gated. This is the one place that list lives.
 *
 * The irreducible coupling is the LIST of sections, not their semantics: each
 * check below reproduces the gate its section actually uses in
 * `resources/views/people/provider/_profile.antlers.html`. Two cases in
 * `ProviderProfileBodyResolverTest` hold that coupling — one covering every handle
 * here against real entries, and an "accounts for every section" case that counts
 * the section-producing partial calls between the two CTA include sites and pins
 * the total, so a section ADDED to or REMOVED from the profile reddens the suite
 * until this list is updated.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT verified, and is an accepted gap: that a given section's
 * gate and its check here agree on the same EDGE value. No test evaluates the two
 * against one another. That gap already bit once — a whitespace-only podcast guest
 * name rendered the section while this returned false — so each check names the
 * gate it mirrors, to be re-read as a pair whenever either side moves.
 *
 * The bias is deliberately toward rendering: an unrecognized shape counts as
 * content. Over-reporting reproduces the pre-existing duplicate CTA in a narrow
 * case; under-reporting would DROP the foot-of-page CTA from a real profile,
 * which is a regression against a patient trying to book.
