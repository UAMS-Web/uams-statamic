/**
 * A stored `scope_joiner` outside the configured option keys falls back to the
 * default joiner, and no fixture relies on that (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#2408, UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#2546).
 *
 * The fallback is correct: an unknown stored key should degrade to the default
 * rather than emit a broken phrase. It is also silent, which is what let two
 * fixtures store `of` -- then never a configured key -- and compose `for` for as
 * long as they existed. Nothing failed, so nothing said so. Since UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#2546 `of` IS a
 * configured key and the five combined keys are not, so a row that was never
 * migrated by `role-title:collapse-scope-joiners` degrades the same silent way.
 *
 * These tests pin both halves: that the degradation is deliberate, and that no
 * fixture is depending on it.
