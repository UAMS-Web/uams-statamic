 * Refuses a scoped editor's save of a `people` entry that would leave the entry
 * outside their organizations (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3182, decided on UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3128).
 *
 * The entry policy stops a scoped editor opening an entry that is out of scope,
 * but creating an entry is authorized against the collection alone, and a change
 * can remove the organization that put the entry in scope. This check runs on the
 * entry as it is about to be written, so a new entry must name one of the
 * editor's organizations, and a change must keep one.
 *
 * It applies only while a scoped user is signed in, so imports, console commands
 * and administrators are unaffected. A change to a published entry under
 * revisions is written as a working copy rather than saved, so it does not reach
 * this check; the policy has already limited it to entries in scope.
