 *
 * Statamic shows a read-only field greyed out but still writes whatever value a
 * request carries, so the lock is enforced here, on the data about to be
 * written. A change to a published entry is written as a working copy (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3127)
 * rather than saved, so the working copy is held to the same values when it is
 * saved, and so is a working copy made by restoring an older revision.
 *
 * The stored values are put back rather than the save refused: a locked field
 * comes back from the publish form in whatever shape its fieldtype submits,
 * which need not match how it is stored, and refusing on that difference would
 * stop every save of an untouched entry.
