/**
 * Proves that a migration touching the `emeritus` / `emerita` guards in
 * `config/role_title.php` changed no schema output.
 *
 * 34 of the 37 honorific conditions are `not_contains_any` guards of the form
 * "this rule applies only when `title_options` does not carry the honorific".
 * When the honorific moves out of `title_options`, every one of those becomes
 * vacuously true: the condition still evaluates, still passes, and the rule it
 * guards starts firing for exactly the titles it was written to exclude. Nothing
 * errors and no other test fails, so this matrix is the instrument that would
 * notice.
 *
 * The matrix is DERIVED from the config rather than enumerated here, so a schema
 * rule added later is covered without a test edit.
 *
 * @command  php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/Support/RoleTitleSchemaMatrixTest.php
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CONTROL, WRITTEN DOWN SO IT CAN BE RE-RUN RATHER THAN TRUSTED.
 *
 * A matrix that silently covers nothing passes exactly like one that covers
 * everything, so the only evidence that this file can fail is watching it fail.
 * Invert one guard, confirm red, restore, confirm green:
 *
 *   # 1. copy the config aside -- NOT `git stash`, which is shared between
 *   #    worktrees and pops another session's entry
 *   cp config/role_title.php /tmp/role_title.php.orig
 *
 *   # 2. invert exactly ONE `not_contains_any` guard, asserting the edit applied.
 *   #    An edit that silently fails to match reads as a passing control and is
 *   #    the failure this step exists to exclude.
 *   python3 - <<'EOF'
 *   import io
 *   p = 'config/role_title.php'
 *   s = io.open(p, encoding='utf-8').read()
 *   before = s.count("'operator' => 'not_contains_any'")
 *   assert before == 34, before
 *   s = s.replace("'operator' => 'not_contains_any'", "'operator' => 'contains_any'", 1)
 *   assert s.count("'operator' => 'not_contains_any'") == 33
 *   io.open(p, 'w', encoding='utf-8').write(s)
 *   EOF
 *
 *   # 3. expect RED, naming the rule, the configuration and the honorific state
 *   php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/Support/RoleTitleSchemaMatrixTest.php
 *
 *   # 4. restore and expect GREEN
 *   cp /tmp/role_title.php.orig config/role_title.php
 *
 * Measured on macOS (Darwin 25.6.0), PHP 8.4.23, at `e3d214487`. Inverting the
 * first guard moved 16 cases -- rule `#0 role=chancellor` across all four
 * configurations and all four honorific states -- and each was reported by label:
 *
 *   CHANGED: #0 role=chancellor hierarchical_modifier=null positional_qualifier=null :: faculty :: none
 *   CHANGED: #0 role=chancellor hierarchical_modifier=null positional_qualifier=null :: academic_leadership :: emeritus
 *   ...
 *
 * Restoring the guard returned all four tests to green with the config
 * byte-identical to HEAD.
