/**
 * Re-indexes provider eligibility for the people linked to practice locations whose date has passed
 * since the last run (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3178).
 *
 * `clinical_locations` is dated with `future: private`, so a location published with a future date is
 * scheduled, and a scheduled location confers clinical provider profile eligibility only from its date
 * (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3176). When that date passes, the location's status changes with no save, so nothing refreshes the
 * linked people's `clinical_provider_profile_eligible_query` index; this job does, through
 * {@see ProviderEligibilityIndexRefresher}, the same path the save and delete listener takes.
 *
 * A new job rather than an extension of {@see ApplyScheduledPublishing}: that job writes `publish_at`
 * and `unpublish_at` on undated collections and saves entries, while this one saves nothing and only
 * re-reads a status that `date_behavior` already resolves. It also belongs to the clinical provider
 * layer, which moves into `uams-web/statamic-people` (#281), while scheduled publishing stays in the site.
 *
 * The time of the last run is kept in the cache. A run with no previous time, the first after a deploy
 * or after the cache is cleared, treats every location dated up to now as passed, which costs one wider
 * refresh and never misses a date. Each run reads only published locations.
 *
 * The job is unique while it is queued or running. The lock expires after the {@see UniqueFor} attribute's
 * seconds, so a run that never finished, such as one whose worker was killed, cannot block every
 * later dispatch (#488). A location's date then takes effect at most that much later.
 *
 * Dispatched by the schedule in `routes/console.php`, at the cadence in
 * `clinical_provider_profile.location_date_refresh.cron`.
 *
 * One hour is forty times the queue's default `retry_after` of 90 seconds, the longest a job can
 * run on those settings before the queue hands it out again. No production run has been timed.
