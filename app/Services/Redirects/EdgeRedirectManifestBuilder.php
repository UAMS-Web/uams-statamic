/**
 * Builds the edge redirect manifest for one site: the part of the `redirects`
 * global set an edge can serve without PHP, in a provider-neutral form (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#1935).
 *
 * UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#1935 decided that the edge carries a static-safe subset and that everything
 * else keeps being served by the existing PHP path. The same decision left the
 * output target open, Cloudflare rules or a `_redirects` file, until there is
 * something to deploy to, so this emits neither. It emits the subset with the
 * engine's semantics written out as data, and a renderer for whichever target is
 * chosen reads the manifest.
 *
 * The rules are read through `RedirectRuleMatcher::rulesForSite()`, the same merge
 * the serving tag uses, and filtered with the same helpers the matcher uses, so
 * the manifest and the engine cannot disagree about which rules exist.
 *
 * **Leaving a rule out is not enough on its own, and this is the load-bearing
 * part.** The engine walks rules in order and serves the first match. A rule the
 * edge cannot evaluate, a regex or one with a validity window, may match at
 * request time, and when it does it wins over every rule after it. An edge that
 * simply dropped it would serve the next rule instead, which the engine would not.
 * So:
 *
 *   - an exact source whose first rule the edge cannot evaluate is sent to the
 *     origin, together with every later rule for that source; and
 *   - the pattern list stops at the first pattern rule the edge cannot evaluate,
 *     because a regex's matches cannot be expressed at an edge.
 *
 * A request that matches nothing in the manifest goes to the origin, which serves
 * it exactly as today. The manifest is therefore conservative: whatever it serves,
 * the engine serves identically, and everything else is left to PHP.
 *
 * The engine's matching and its redirect are also narrower than they look, and the
 * manifest follows both rather than the rule data alone:
 *
 *   - it matches against a path Statamic has tidied, so a request carrying a
 *     backslash, a colon or a doubled slash is left to the origin, and a source
 *     containing one, which the engine can never match, is left out;
 *   - it redirects through Laravel's URL generator, which roots a relative target
 *     and trims its trailing slash, so fixed targets are emitted rooted and the
 *     edge roots a remainder target once the remainder is appended; and
 *   - only a url target redirects at the edge. An entry target resolves through the
 *     serving template on every request, and follows the entry when it moves.
 *
 * Disabled and unapproved rules are left out as the engine would skip them at the
 * moment of generation. Both can change in the Control Panel without a deploy, so
 * the manifest is a snapshot that a deploy regenerates, as UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#1935 records.
