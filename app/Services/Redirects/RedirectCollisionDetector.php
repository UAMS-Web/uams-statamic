/**
 * Detects redirect source collisions within overlapping validity windows (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#1356).
 *
 * A vanity URL can only point one place at a time, so two redirects that claim
 * the same (normalized) source with validity windows that intersect on any day
 * are a conflict the utility must surface *before* saving — otherwise an editor
 * unknowingly overrides a live redirect, or two "valid" redirects race on the
 * same 404. Two redirects on the same source with non-overlapping windows are
 * allowed (a source can legitimately point different places in different date
 * ranges), and a redirect with no window collides with any other on the source.
 *
 * The detector is a pure function of its inputs — no facades, no I/O — so it is
 * exhaustively unit-testable and reusable by the CP store and any later slice.
