/**
 * Antlers modifier: filter a list of `people` entries down to those renderable as
 * clinical providers — eligible for a UAMS Health clinical provider profile AND
 * currently searchable (not in an active separation window, not hidden from
 * provider lists).
 *
 * This is the UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#919 shared "provider relationship" output filter for authored
 * `entries` relationships (`physician_locations`, `clinical_providers`) that are
 * rendered as augmented lists rather than via a `{{ collection:people }}` tag. It
 * mirrors the FaD Providers block's
 * `clinical_provider_profile_eligible_query:is="true" searchable:is="true"` tag
 * conditions: both express the same predicate through the same
 * {@see ProviderPeopleListingComputedValues} methods, so a person listed as a
 * provider anywhere is filtered consistently, without re-solving eligibility per
 * template.
 *
 * Use at each provider-relationship render site, e.g.:
 *   {{ physician_locations | clinical_provider_eligible }}
 *
 * Eligibility is evaluated on the entry directly (not a stored value), so it stays
 * correct as eligibility drifts over time and does not depend on the entries query
 * driver. Non-`people`/unresolvable items are dropped.
