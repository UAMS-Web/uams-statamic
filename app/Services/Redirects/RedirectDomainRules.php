/**
 * Reads the `redirect_domains` collection into redirect rules grouped by host,
 * in the shape `EdgeRedirectManifestBuilder` reads from the `redirects` global set
 * (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#2678).
 *
 * UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#2594 decided that redirects for domains that are not Statamic sites are
 * authored as entries, each carrying a host, and that the edge generator emits one
 * manifest per host. An entry is one of two kinds:
 *
 *   - a whole-domain entry, which becomes a single `/*` rule with a fixed target,
 *     so every path on the host goes to one URL with nothing appended; or
 *   - a source entry, which becomes the same rule a `redirects` global-set row
 *     with the same fields would be.
 *
 * An entry target is resolved here, to the entry's absolute URL at the moment the
 * rules are read. These domains never reach Statamic, so the serving template that
 * resolves an entry target for the main site never runs for them, and a relative
 * URL would stay on the redirecting domain. Reading the URL at generation time is
 * what lets a domain follow its destination when that entry moves: the next
 * manifest carries the new URL. A target entry that cannot be resolved, because it
 * is missing, unpublished or has no URL, is left as an entry target, which the
 * builder hands to the origin, and is counted so the command can report it.
