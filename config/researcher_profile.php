    | Researcher people-lens eligibility signals (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#1667)
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | A person qualifies for the `researcher` people lens when ANY of these
    | `people` fields is non-empty — i.e. the person has a public research
    | identity (a UAMS TRI research profile, a scholarly author identifier, or
    | declared research interests).
    |
    | Unlike the org-derived academic / institutional lenses (gated by a site's
    | organization roster over the org-to-people bridge), the researcher signal is
    | PERSON-LEVEL: researchers are scattered across many sites with no single
    | research organization, and the org-role map (`config/department_hub.php`)
    | has no research role. So the lens gates on the person, not the site — it is
    | registered on every site and this signal is the filter (mirroring the
    | person-level clinical eligibility gate, `config/clinical_provider_profile`).
    |
    | Add a handle here to widen what counts as a researcher.
