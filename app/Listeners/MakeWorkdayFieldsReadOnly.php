 *
 * Statamic shares one blueprint object between the entries of a request, so the
 * visibility is set in both directions on every dispatch rather than only
 * switched on: a trainee field locked for one entry must not stay greyed out on
 * the next. The field's own visibility is kept under a private config key the
 * first time it is changed, and is what an unlocked field returns to. This is
 * only the editing surface; `RestoreWorkdayManagedFields` is what keeps a
 * locked value unchanged on save.
 *
 * It also marks `workday_gender` "Overridden" when the entry's `gender` differs
 * from it (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3133), for every user, administrators included, since the marker
 * only describes the entry and locks nothing.
