/**
 * Whether a provider's medical-ontology sections are suppressed by an editor-configured
 * removal rule (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#1687).
 *
 * WordPress computes `$hide_medical_ontology` on the provider profile from the
 * **Remove Medical Ontology** tab of the Find-a-Doc settings: a replicator of rows, each
 * pairing an optional service line with an optional region. A provider is suppressed when
 * EVERY non-empty criterion in a row matches; an all-empty row matches nothing; the first
 * matching row wins. Those semantics are ported faithfully.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately NOT ported, both recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`:
 *
 * 1. **Only the routable section honors this.** WordPress hid links to three ontology
 *    collections. Here `clinical_expertise` is routable while `clinical_conditions` and
 *    `clinical_services` are not, so conditions and treatments render as plain text with
 *    nothing to link away from. Only Areas of Expertise is suppressed.
 * 2. **Region matching is ANY, not sole.** WordPress compares
 *    `in_array(implode('', $provider_region), $remove_region)`, concatenating a provider's
 *    region ids into one string — so a provider in two regions becomes `"6566"` and can
 *    never match a removal list of `["65"]`. That is a string-concatenation accident, not
 *    a rule. A provider matches here when ANY of their regions is the row's region.
 *
 * The flag is computed once per provider and honored only on the profile render, so a
 * suppressed provider still appears in Find-a-Doc listings and on Areas-of-Expertise
 * pages. That boundary is deliberate and its residue is tracked separately.

     *
     * A replicator augments to a plain PHP array rather than to a query builder, so an
     * absent or empty value is genuinely falsy here, unlike an `entries` relation,
     * which augments to a query builder that is truthy even when empty.
     *
     * A row the editor DISABLED is skipped. `Variables::get()` returns the raw stored
     * data rather than the augmented value, so the `enabled` flag Statamic's own
     * `Replicator::performAugmentation()` acts on is still present here and has to be
     * honored by hand — otherwise a rule an editor paused with the set's disable toggle
     * goes on silently hiding clinical content, with nothing to tell them why the toggle
     * did nothing. Tested `!== false` rather than for truthiness because an ABSENT flag
     * means enabled, matching both the fieldtype and `ProviderProfileBodyResolver`.
     *
     * Row keys are typed `mixed` rather than `string` deliberately: these rows are
     * whatever an editor's global holds, and claiming string keys would be an assertion
     * this method never checks. Every read is a `?? null` lookup, which needs no more.
