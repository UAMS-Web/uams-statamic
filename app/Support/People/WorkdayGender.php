 *
 * `gender` stays the field every reader uses. `workday_gender` holds what the
 * Workday sync last sent, and only the sync writes it. The sync copies its value
 * into `gender` only while `gender` is empty or still equals the previous
 * `workday_gender`; otherwise the entry is overridden, and a new Workday value
 * keeps the override and flags the entry for review. The flag is a data key
 * outside the blueprint, so no Control Panel form can set or clear it, and it is
 * cleared by confirming the override or by taking Workday's value. Nothing here
 * saves the entry or sends mail: the caller saves.
