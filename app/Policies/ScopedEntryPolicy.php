 * Statamic's entry policy, with `people` entries limited to the organizations of
 * the user's groups (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3182, decided on UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3128).
 *
 * The permission checks are Statamic's own; this only adds that a scoped user may
 * view, edit, delete or publish a `people` entry when the entry is in their scope
 * (see {@see PeopleEditingScope}). Every other collection, and every administrator,
 * is left exactly as Statamic decides. The role scoped editors hold carries no
 * publish permission, so in practice only administrators publish; the scope on
 * publishing covers a role that is later given that permission.
