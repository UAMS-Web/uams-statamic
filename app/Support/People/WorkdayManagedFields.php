 * `workday_gender` (see `WorkdayGender`). A trainee status field is Workday's only once the Workday sync has
 * listed it in the entry's `workday_supplied` data, which only the sync writes;
 * until then it is an ordinary field an editor answers. The administrators the
 * people editing scope leaves unscoped (super users, and users who may configure
 * collections) are exempt, so they can enter and correct these values while no
 * sync exists. With no signed-in user (an import, a console command, the sync
 * itself) nothing is locked.
