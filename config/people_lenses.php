    |
    | A lens is a site-specific render of one canonical `people` entry —
    | (template, gate, route, sites) — for a particular audience. The clinical
    | provider lens is the first concrete instance (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#571); the org-gated lenses
    | derive their audience from the org-to-people bridge (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#1556 / UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#1557). Each
    | descriptor:
    |
    |   - `template`  Antlers view under `resources/views/people/<lens>/` rendered
    |                 for this lens (base `people/show` for the ungated general lens).
    |   - `gate`      a `LensGate` class deciding whether a resolved person may be
    |                 rendered through this lens on the current site; `null` = no gate.
    |   - `route`     the URL pattern (with `{slug}`) at which the lens renders,
    |                 relative to each active site's own URL prefix.
    |   - `sites`     the site handles the lens is active on; `['*']` = every site.
    |
    | The clinical lens fits this registry with no special-casing — it is just the
    | descriptor whose gate is the UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#919 eligibility filter.
