/**
 * Ports Safe Redirect Manager's pattern-matching semantics onto the `redirects`
 * global set.
 *
 * The `redirects` store is a near-1:1 port of the WordPress Safe Redirect Manager
 * (SRM) schema, and the importer writes SRM rules into it verbatim. SRM matches a
 * stored source three ways — literally, by a trailing-`*` wildcard, and by PCRE —
 * and this class carries the two pattern forms so a rule imported from WordPress
 * fires here exactly as it did there. The literal form stays in the serving tag.
 *
 * Three behaviors are faithful ports rather than reinventions, and each one is
 * load-bearing:
 *   - A wildcard base keeps its trailing slash, so `/foo/*` matches `/foo` itself
 *     as well as everything beneath it, and never matches `/foobar`.
 *   - The remainder appended to a `*`-terminated target is read from the
 *     original-case URI, while the match that found it is case-insensitive.
 *   - Case folding is byte-wise, matching SRM's `strtolower()`. This class does
 *     offset arithmetic against the un-folded URI, and only a byte-length-stable
 *     fold keeps those offsets aligned; multibyte folding does not.
 *
 * One behavior deliberately diverges. SRM skips capture substitution whenever the
 * target passes `filter_var($target, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)`, so an absolute-URL
 * target redirects to a literal `$1`. That is a defect rather than a contract —
 * 76 of the 508 capture-carrying rules in the export corpus are broken by it in
 * WordPress today — so this port substitutes unconditionally.
