 * Refuses a scoped editor's save that would change a `people` entry outside their

 * field the addon syncs into `people`).
 *
 * The Stillat relationships addon keeps each field below in sync with its
 * reciprocal on `people` (registered in `StillatRelationshipsServiceProvider`),
 * and writes the person with `saveQuietly()` after the save, so
 * `EnforcePeopleEditingScope` never sees that write. Adding a person to
 * one of these fields, or removing one, rewrites that person's record, so a
 * scoped editor may only add or remove people in scope. People already listed
 * and left unchanged do not block the save, so an entry that lists another
 * organization's person stays editable. Listing another organization's person is
 * an administrator's change.
 *
 * The addon writes on `EntrySaved` and only records state on `EntrySaving`, so
 * refusing here stops both the entry and the person being written. It is listed
 * in `EventServiceProvider::$listen` after `EnforcePeopleEditingScope` (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3240).
