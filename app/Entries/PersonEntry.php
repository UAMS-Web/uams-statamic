/**
 * Custom Entry class for the `people` collection.

 * page for this person?" toggle (`profile_page_query`) is explicitly disabled.
 * The entry stays published and queryable — it still feeds the People Showcase
 * block/Bard set and other listings — but becomes non-routable, so Statamic
 * returns a 404 for its `people/{slug}` URL and `{{ url }}` resolves to null
 * (the People Showcase heading then renders unlinked).
 *
 * The suppression hooks `route()`: returning null makes `Entry::uri()`
 * short-circuit to null, which Statamic treats as non-routable everywhere it
 * matters (the Stache URI index, `{{ url }}`, and front-end route resolution).
 * This is the idiomatic Statamic mechanism — no bespoke controller/404 guard.
