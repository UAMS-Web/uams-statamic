 * Clinical provider profile eligibility requires a published entry in `clinical_locations` (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3123), so
 * a person's `clinical_provider_profile_eligible_query` computed value depends on another entry's status.
 * The Stache refreshes a computed value index only when the indexed entry itself is saved, so without
 * this listener publishing, unpublishing or deleting a location would leave the provider listings that
 * filter on that index (`clinical_provider_profile_eligible_query:is="true"`) stale until each person
 * was re-saved or the Stache rebuilt. A location whose date passes without a save is caught by
 * {@see RefreshProviderEligibilityForDatedLocations} instead (UAMS-Web/uams-statamic-archive#3178).
